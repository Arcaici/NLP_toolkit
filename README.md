# NLP_toolkit
Repository of different functions useful for general NLP task:

## tools contents
* nlp_tools.py : main tools for preprocess text datasets.
* plot_tools.py : useful plot for exctract information about text and label.
* transformer_tools.py : tools based on LLM and useful fuction for exctract feature from data using trasformers.
* multilabel_tool.py : Models and gridsearch implementation of sk-multilearn library, useful for multi-label classification
## test notebooks
* Trasformer_tools_test.ipynb: notebook that test all fuctions of transformer_tools.py script and all nlp_tool.py fuctions about loss
* multilabel_tools_test.ipynb: notebook that test, in general, some usefull functions of sk-multilearn library
* cleaning_examples.ipynb: notebook that test and explore text preprocessing functions and useful plots
